# Analyzing-Political-Trends-of-Indian-American

Indian American community in US has gained a growing political influence in recent times and has come to recognised as a important electorate to cater to for the political parties on both sides of political divide. Given such prominence, no or very little has been done to analyse their political bias specially when the electorate remains divided. We propose to analyze the trends and biases of the Indian-American community from their real-time opinions on social media to get the sense of ground truth in an much robust way. <br />
This project does the following -<br />
• Analyzes data from 2.8k unique Indian Americans’ tweets to identify political trends and biases ahead of 2024 presidential elections<br />
• Designs Tableau dashboard illustrating the topics and sentiment within the community based on party affiliations and geographies<br />
